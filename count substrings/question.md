### Question
    Given a string S consisting of only 1s and 0s, find the number of substrings which start and end both in 1.
    In this problem, a substring is defined as a sequence of continuous characters Si, Si+1, ..., Sj where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N.

### Input
>First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N(the length of string) in one line and string in second line.


### Output
>For each testcase, print the required answer in one line.
