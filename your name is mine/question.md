### Question
    In an attempt to control the rise in population, Archer was asked to come up with a plan. This time he is targeting marriages. Archer, being as intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan:
    A man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is a subsequence of W or W is a subsequence of M.
    A is said to be a subsequence of B, if A can be obtained by deleting some elements of B without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    Your task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Archer's rule.

### Input
>The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated strings M and W.

### Output
>For each test case print "YES" if they are allowed to marry, else print "NO". (quotes are meant for clarity, please don't print them)
