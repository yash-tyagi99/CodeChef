### Question
    Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, 
    when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. 
    A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

### Input
>The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three angles A, B and C, of the triangle separated by space

### Output
>For each test case, display 'YES' if the triangle is valid, and 'NO', if it is not, in a new line.
